Welcome to the Final Project for the Front End Foundations course! Great job making it this far! This Final Project will be different from the Hands-On projects you have previously seen in a couple of different ways. For the Final Project, you will be putting together the numerous topics you have learned into one large project. It is designed to mimic real problems which you may face in your career, so it may be a challenge for you and will also take several hours. Take this project step-by-step and be aware that the project description below is written to be a bit less specific than previous Hands-Ons. The Final Project is supposed to challenge you to do some problem solving to figure out how to accomplish a task. You can always review past lessons or use a Google search if needed. Good luck!

Caution!
Do not submit your project until you have completed all requirements, as you will not be able to resubmit.

Requirements
To begin, create a new project in your FrontEndFoundations folder named L10HandsOn. You will be responsible for creating the necessary files. Your goal for this project is to create a website that has the following features:

Layout your page using Flexbox or Bootstrap.
Include a header with your name and your job title (ie. Web Developer, Full Stack Developer, etc..)
An image of yourself so everyone knows who you are.
If you are uncomfortable including a picture of yourself, please use a placeholder image
Clickable GitHub icon linking to your GitHub.
Clickable LinkedIn icon linking to your LinkedIn.
Clickable icon links to other Social Media sites (ie. Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc..)
Using jQuery, when your icons are hovered over they should transform in size using CSS to show animation.
List your tech-related skills.
Dynamically list your GitHub repositories using an AJAX request.
You will need the following API endpoint with your username. https://api.github.com/users/YOURUSERNAME/repos
Hint! Post the above into the web browser and you will see all of your repos listed as a JSON object
Include a footer that sticks to the bottom of the screen, commonly referred to as a sticky footer.
The footer should contain contact information with an email icon and an email address listed next to it.
Style your page using CSS.
Tip!
In order to get what you want from CSS, you can take many approaches and solve the problem many ways. The curriculum is not and can never be the final source for all things programming. In this project, you are asked to use a 'sticky footer'. This requirement is not a new concept, but it is a combination of basic attributes that produce the result. Think of this requirement as something that you need to think through to find a solution. Always be ready to Google something when you run into something you haven't seen before!
